* All biome IDs known to WorldEdit: see [Java definitions][we-biometypes]
  * Unfortunately, WorldEdit devs
    [are not interested](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldEdit/issues/2331)
    in adding easy-to-parse dimension info to that list.
  * You can run `./dl_guess.sh` to download the WE biomes list and generate
    lists for the end and the overworld based on keyword guessing.
